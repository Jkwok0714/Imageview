# Perugia View

Reviving the React-ImageView to experiment with packaging with the following goals:

- File system integration
- Working with menus and "native" bits
- Packaging
- A tool for family to use that doesn't blow up every 5 images

## Setup + Build

Local development:

```bash
cd perugia-view
npm i
npm run dev
```

Will build with vite and with tauri:

```bash
npm run test-build
```

## Legacy project

Legacy project from included in the `legacy` folder. Will probably deprecate and delete but for now it's funny to laugh at.
